# Pouya Sadeghpoor's Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my work and skills as a Frontend Developer and 3D Artist. The website is designed to be a clean, modern, and interactive experience for visitors.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Single-Page Layout**: A smooth, single-page experience with full-page sections.
*   **Interactive Navigation**: Navigate through sections using the mouse wheel, touch gestures, or keyboard arrows. A sleek side navigation bar also shows the current section.
*   **Loading Animation**: A simple and elegant loading animation that counts up to 100%.
*   **Dynamic Content**: The portfolio includes sections for an introduction, selected work experience, a toolkit of my skills, and a way to connect.
*   **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.
*   **Dark Mode**: The website has a dark mode theme.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern tech stack, including:

*   **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework for production.
*   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**: A library for animations. (Note: I see a lot of animation code, so I'm assuming this or a similar library is intended to be used, or the animations are custom CSS/JS).
*   **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: A collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)**: A library of popular icons.
